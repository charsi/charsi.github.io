<p>TLDR; Get a tomato-capable router. Use its multi-WAN function to fuse connections from two ISPs together</p>

<h3>Rant</h3>

<p>Internet situation in India is bad. I am currently living in New Delhi but was based in UK for the last 5 years. I had got used to 50mbps and even 100mbps unlimited connections. After moving back I was a bit surprised to learn things hadn&rsquo;t moved on much at all since I left. Only a couple of ISPs (Airtel and MTNL) in Delhi were capable of providing stable connections. Fast, unlimited plans were nowhere to be found. I was frequently paying more than Rs4,000 per month for internet, due to all the additional data I was using. This was on Airtel&rsquo;s 8mbps plan which came with a 80GB &lsquo;FUP&rsquo;[^1]. I was paying far less for completely unlimited 50mbps/100mbps plans back in UK!</p>

<p>So I bit the bullet and got a connection from a local ISP called &lsquo;Excitel&rsquo;. I had never heard of them and was dubious about their ability to provide a reliable connection. But their 50mbps <strong>unlimited</strong> connection at Rs 800 per month was enticing enough. Four guys turned up to do the installation. The internet came over a LAN cable flung from the nearest khamba[^5]. I had last got internet this way more than 10 years ago[^2]. As expected the connection was very unreliable. I was raising several support tickets each week to get the connectivity restored each time it went down.
I had wisely not disconnected Airtel yet. So whenever Excitel went down I could switch wifi connections and start using Airtel for a few hours. So I now had unlimited internet for about Rs1800 per month for the two connections(after switching to Airtel&rsquo;s lowest 10GB plan). But the manual switching of wifi connections was getting annoying.</p>

<p>After a few months of putting up with this I finally put a solution in place. I have been running  <a href="https://advancedtomato.com/">Tomato firmware</a>[^3] on my router since many years. And recently the developers added multi-WAN functionality to the firmware. Perfect. I updated the router and made the required configuration changes and lived happily ever after.</p>

<h3>How-To</h3>

<p>Here are the steps to follow if you find yourself in a similar situation -</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a router that supports <a href="https://advancedtomato.com/">Tomato firmware</a> (anything that has a broadcom chip inside). Get one of <a href="https://advancedtomato.com/downloads">these</a> if you are unsure. I am using a Netgear WNR3500L v2[^4].</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Download tomato  for your router from <a href="https://advancedtomato.com/downloads">here</a> if you want the new slick UI or from <a href="http://tomato.groov.pl/?page_id=164">here</a> if you like the old school look.</li>
<li>Open your router settings page. Usually at <code>192.168.1.1</code> or <code>192.168.0.1</code>.</li>
<li>Find the option to upgrade firmware and upload the tomato firmware file.</li>
<li>Wait for the firmware to be installed and pray your router doesnâ€™t get bricked.</li>
<li>Once the new firmware is installed go to <code>192.168.1.1</code> and navigate to <code>Advanced &gt; VLAN</code> on the sidebar</li>
<li>Uncheck port 1 for <code>LAN(br0)</code></li>
<li>On the last row select &lsquo;WAN2&rsquo; from the drop-down and select port 1. Click Add. This will designate Port 1 to be used as your second WAN port. Your screen should be looking like the screenshot below now. <img src="/images/redundant-internet-using-tomato-capable-router/Screenshot_1.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Click save and navigate to <code>Basic &gt; Network</code></li>
<li>Select &lsquo;2WAN&rsquo; for number of WAN ports option.</li>
<li>Configure WAN 1 details as provided by your ISP. Connection type would probably be DHCP or pppoe with a user name and password.</li>
<li>For WAN 2 set the connection type to DHCP and load balance weight to 0.</li>
<li>Configure your wifi name and password on the same page. Click save and wait for the router to reboot. <img src="/images/redundant-internet-using-tomato-capable-router/Screenshot_3.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Connect an ethernet cable from one of the LAN ports on your Airtel/MTNL modem to port 1 on the tomato router.</li>
<li>Done</li>
</ul>

<p>You should now have an always up connection which automatically falls back to using your 2nd ISP when the first one goes down.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can also use another open-source firmware - <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/">dd-wrt</a> to achieve similar results. If you already have a router <a href="https://dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices">compatible</a> with dd-wrt you should give it a shot first. I don&rsquo;t have any experience with it so please get <a href="https://www.google.co.in/search?q=ddwrt+multiwan">google</a> to help you with this.</li>
<li>When the router is using ISP2 with the above setup you are accessing the internet via two devices. This will cause a &lsquo;double-NAT&rsquo; situation, which can cause problems for services such as torrents and VOIP. An easy fix would be to put the IP address of the tomato router in &lsquo;DMZ&rsquo; on the modem/router for ISP2.</li>
<li>It is possible to have the router send push alerts to your phone every time one of the connections goes down. I will write a separate post on how to set this up.</li>
<li>Airtel has upped its smallest plan&rsquo;s data from 10 to 25 GB now so I am less concerned about going over in the periods Excitel is down. However it would still be a good idea to keep track of usage on the backup connection.</li>
</ul>

[^2]: Anyone remember Sify Broadband?
[^3]: Tomato is an opensource firmware that can supercharge your router.
