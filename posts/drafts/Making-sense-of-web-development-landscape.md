I am not a developer and never been trained as one so if you are looking for highly technical expert opinion I am not the person to get it from. I have however over the last couple of years paid very close attention to various options in the web developments space. Doing this is not good for anyone's health. In the last 5 years or so mostly tanks to one big development a number of frameworks, markup languages and we standards have been introduced. Here is a quick rundown of the current state of things and information that I think would help a new web developer.

With that out of the way.. let's jump in.

Javascript.
This thing runs the web these days. Because now js support is taken for granted in most browsers a lot of client side heavy lifting is done with js.

'client side' If that doesn't make sense please read on a bit more.

JS has also jumped on to the server side. This is old news now and nodejs is the product of this innovation.

client side frameworks-
Angular
Ember

both of the above are __strictly__ client side. So they don't need node installed on the server in order to run. However they make extensive use of it in development so node is a prerequisite on the dev machine. However once your app is done you can easily upload it to a sever with just apache or nginx and the app will run happily. You will have to run the database and api for the app somewhere too but they can be completely separate from the angular/ember app.  

Now where do you start?

My recommendation.. get comfortable with one one of the following languages.. 
python
php
javascript

I would recommend python over the others and
