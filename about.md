I am a software developer living in Vancouver, Canada. I currently work for a [Change Healthcare](https://www.changehealthcare.com/solutions/enterprise-imaging)'s imaging business. I split my time writing application code and developing cloud infrastructure automation. I work mostly with C#/.NET, Typescript/Node and IaaC technologies like Cloudformation and Terraform. 

I have a backgound in large scale 3D simulations and VR. Previously based in London, UK. I grew up in New Delhi, India.
