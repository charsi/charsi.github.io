A few years ago I tried to learn to read Urdu. It is basically the same language as Hindi with a different script so I figured it won't be too hard. I was living with a few Pakistani friends at the time but they didn't prove to be much help. So, I used the internet instead and after a few weeks I could just about recognize a few letters. I could even read read some shop signs written in Urdu around Luton[^1] albeit very slowly.

I left it at that until last year when I moved back to India. I took some classes at [Zabaan](zabaan.com). And I can now easily read signs around Delhi that are written in Urdu. Not terribly useful as on the same board the text is repeated in two other languages I can read. But it has still been quite a fulfilling endeavour. My granddad who could read and write Urdu passed away last year but before then I was able to show him I was picking up the language. He was probably more confused than the Pakistanis about my motives but that is a different story. 

Although only a few of these apply in my case here is a list of reasons I have come up for Hindi speakers to learn the Nastaliq script. 

1. Learning languages is fun.
* It will be the easiest language you learn.
* You will be able to read Persian and Arabic too. 
* You should. You really should. The reason for you not learning it at school is political. It shouldn't have been. You can fix it with a few weeks effort.
      



About six years ago I landed in UK for a masters degree in business management or something. I don't quite remember. I do remember however that my class had a bunch of people from India (including me) and Pakistan. All of us could understand each other without any effort. There were only a couple of words I learned that Pakistanis seemed to use more often - "Maslan?", "na kar". I usually have more trouble understanding Punjabi that is sometimes spoken in my home. Leaving Delhi, almost everywhere else the language is more alien to me. 

If you are one of half a billion people who understand Hindi or Urdu. I urge you to go an learn the other script for your language. I Well maybe not all. If you have the time and the inclination. This post is just some motivation to push you over the edge.

Our language Urdu-Hindi is beautiful. I know this because for a few years I didn't have many people I could speak in Hindi with on a regular basis. Things are easier to express in Hindi-Urdu and no matter how much of a 'angrez-ki-aulad'[^2] you are, for some things Hindi will remain the perfect language. 

So here is my pitch for you learning the 'other' script for the language you already speak.
