I'm a software developer living in Vancouver, Canada. I currently work for a [healthcare company](https://www.changehealthcare.com/solutions/enterprise-imaging). I split my time writing application code developing cloud infrastructure automation. I work mostly with .NET, Typescript/Node and IaaC technologies like Cloudformation and Terraform. 

I have a backgound in large scale 3D simulations and VR. Previously based in London, UK. I grew up in New Delhi, India.
